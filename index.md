## Personal Profile

Extremely motivated to constantly develop my skills and grow professionally. Eager to take on new challenges. Always involved in the work of the team.

## Non-commercial Experience

`Feb'21-now`
__Software Team Leader, [Proton Dynamic](https://www.facebook.com/protondynamic) (The Electric Formula Student team)__

State current and long-term goals and tasks. Reorganized work by applying agile development methods. Providing training to members: our engineering tools, communication protocols used in vehicles, RTOS (real-time operating systems), safety critical systems requirements, software development methods, work organization. Supervising task accomplishment. Mentoring inexperienced members. 

Current projects:

1) PD-ECUs

Maintenance and development of the software embedded in ECUs (electronic control units). Our ECUs, similar to those in road vehicles, monitor the condition of the vehicle and allow driver controls the vehicle. Communication between ECUs and other electronic devices contained in the racing car are realized by CAN bus. The beginning of the current iteration of the software was realized by the framework that was created as part of my engineering thesis.

2) PD-logger-master

The main task of the team is to provide solutions for logging data generated by the car and processing it into formats that allow analysis by simulation teams. A Raspberry Pi based system is used for data logging, combined with a self built Pi HAT.

3) PD-logger-node

A project carried out by little experienced members, whose goal is to realize measuring ECUs. These bare metal devices measure electrical and non-electrical signals that are sent over the CAN network.

4) PD-bms

The purpose of this project is to develop a proprietary distributed high voltage battery management system (BMS). 

5) PD-web

Redevelopment of [our website](http://protondynamic.pl/), results coming soon. Support the PD-logger-master project.

`May'19-now`
__Software Engineer, Proton Dynamic__

Most of responsibilities are included with current projects listed above. Currently, I support projects on a much smaller scale.

`Oct'18-Sep'19`
__Electric Control And Safety Systems Designer, Proton Dynamic__

Create and develop solutions for the control and safety system applied in the Formula Student electric racing car.

## Education

`Feb'20-now`
__Master of Computer Science, Warsaw University of Technology__

Specialization: Data Engineering

`Oct'16-Feb'20`
__Bachelor of Mechatronics, Warsaw University of Technology__

Specialization: Electronic Measuring System
